This course project is part of "Data Science Capstone: SwiftKey Project" - Coursera's "Data Science" specialization. Goal of this Capstone project is to use "HC Corpora Dataset" to design and develop a prediction algorithm to predict the most likely the successive word in the sequence of words and host the app using Shiny application.

Inputs from three sources (Twitter, News, Blogs) were considered for sampling. This project will focus on the English language datasets. NLP (Natural Language Processing) and R libraries like "tm" and "RWeka" are used to process and tokenize N-grams as first step towards developing prediction model and algorithm.


Dataset for this project is sourced from this **[website](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/dsscapstone/dataset/Coursera-SwiftKey.zip)**
